# covid19_tti

Repository of scripts and functions for generating figures and data of the related TTI paper. All scripts are named after the figure they generate (understandably, not in "publishing" quality), and they would work as long as the folder "Functions" is added to the path in MATLAB.

## Simulation platform 

An interactive platform for simulating scenarios is available: [covid19-tti.ds.mpg.de](http://covid19-tti.ds.mpg.de/)

The sourcecode for the website is available [here](https://github.com/semohr/covid19_testing).
